### Description:
Journey of The Dino King is a 2D top-down wave based shooter video game. The game was made in the game engine Godot version 4.2.2. The player uses WASD to move and the ARROW KEYS to shoot hordes of enemies in each level. Survive each level to win the game.
### Files and Folders
Let's explore the files and folders.
#### - Notes
The Notes folder holds some notes that I had taken about how to implement code for things. Mainly something that isn't really needed for the game to function but for my, the developer's, benefit.
#### - Assets
The assets folder stores all the assets for the game. Including the art for each sprite, the app icon that shows up for the app on windows, the fonts used, and the sound effects. This folder is a hub for all the media resources used for the game.
#### - Scenes
The scenes folder holds every .tcsn scene file. This is the skeleton of the game and is the bread and butter of Godot. Art, sound, scripts, and many more can be attached to these scenes to create each entity of the game.
#### - Scripts
The scripts folder contains the GDscript files that connect to each respective scene. This can modify and change the state of the game depending on various conditions and is what gives the game its logic and functionality.
### Review
Looking back it is clear that my expectations of how fast and easy this project was going to be was not correct. If I thought one thing would take 30 minutes, it would take 2 hours. If I thought another thing would take 2 hours, it would take 2 days and add another 3 bugs. Programming and game development is extremely difficult to estimate how much time something would take to develop and usaully you underestamate.

Though there is one script that took a while for me to iron out and fix but I am really proud of. And that is the enemy_spawner script. Its logic is great!

# Enemy Spawn System (GDScript Overview)

This script, attached to a `Node2D`, handles **enemy spawning** in a Godot game. It manages enemy waves, spawn timing, and difficulty scaling based on game progression.

---

## Preloaded Scenes & Node References

```gdscript
var enemy_scene = preload("res://scenes/enemy.tscn")
@onready var spawn_timer = $SpawnTimer
@onready var player = get_node("../Player")
```

- `enemy_scene`: Preloaded enemy scene to instantiate during spawns.
- `spawn_timer`: Timer node used for scheduling spawn events.
- `player`: Reference to the player node (assumed to be a sibling of this node).

---

## Spawn Point Management

```gdscript
@onready var spawn_door_dict = {
    "up" : get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("up_enemy_spawn_points"),
    "right" : get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("right_enemy_spawn_points"),
    "down" : get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("down_enemy_spawn_points"),
    "left" : get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("left_enemy_spawn_points")
}

@onready var spawn_queue_dict = {
    "up" : 0,
    "right" : 0,
    "down" : 0,
    "left" : 0
}
```

- **`spawn_door_dict`**: Dictionary containing arrays of spawn points grouped by direction (`"up"`, `"right"`, `"down"`, `"left"`).
- **`spawn_queue_dict`**: Tracks queued enemy count per direction before they are actually spawned.

---

## Difficulty and Spawning Configuration

```gdscript
var difficulty_timer: float = 20.0
var difficulty_level = 0
@export var enemy_wave_spawn_time_range = [1.0, 2.0]
@export var MAX_NUM_SPAWN_PER_DOOR = 4
@export var num_enemy_spawn_per_wave_range = [1, 6]
```

- `difficulty_timer`: Time remaining until the next difficulty increase.
- `difficulty_level`: Current difficulty level; 0 disables spawning.
- `enemy_wave_spawn_time_range`: Range for randomizing spawn wave intervals.
- `MAX_NUM_SPAWN_PER_DOOR`: Maximum number of enemies that can spawn per door in a single wave.
- `num_enemy_spawn_per_wave_range`: Range of enemies to spawn per wave.

---

## Main Game Loop: `_physics_process(delta)`

```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta):
    if difficulty_level == 0:
        if not spawn_timer.is_stopped():
            spawn_timer.stop()
        return

    if spawn_timer.is_stopped():
        spawn_timer.start()

    spawn_enemies_in_spawn_queue()

    difficulty_timer -= delta
    if difficulty_timer <= 0:
        increase_difficulty()
        difficulty_timer = 20.0
```

Handles the core runtime behavior:

1. Stops the timer if difficulty is 0.
2. Starts the timer if it's stopped and difficulty > 0.
3. Spawns any queued enemies (up to 3 per door).
4. Reduces `difficulty_timer` and increases difficulty when it hits zero.

---

## Spawn Timer Callback: `_on_spawn_rate_timeout()`

```gdscript
func _on_spawn_rate_timeout():
    if difficulty_level == 0:
        return

    randomize_wait_time(difficulty_level)

    var enemy_amount_to_spawn = get_random_amount_of_enemies()
    var enemies_to_spawn_dict = get_enemies_to_spawn(enemy_amount_to_spawn)

    for direction in enemies_to_spawn_dict.keys():
        spawn_queue_dict[direction] += enemies_to_spawn_dict[direction]
```

Executed every time the spawn timer runs out:

- Randomizes the next spawn time.
- Chooses a random number of enemies.
- Selects which doors to spawn enemies from.
- Populates `spawn_queue_dict` with pending spawns.

---

## Enemy Spawning Logic: `spawn_enemies_in_spawn_queue()`

```gdscript
func spawn_enemies_in_spawn_queue():
    for direction in spawn_queue_dict.keys():
        if spawn_queue_dict[direction] <= 0:
            continue
        if has_blocked_spawn_door(direction):
            continue

        for i in range(spawn_queue_dict[direction]):
            if i >= 3 or spawn_queue_dict[direction] <= 0:
                break
            var spawn_point = spawn_door_dict[direction][i].global_position
            if player != null:
                spawn_enemy(enemy_scene, spawn_point)
                spawn_queue_dict[direction] -= 1
```

- Iterates over directions in `spawn_queue_dict`.
- Checks if the door is unblocked.
- Spawns up to 3 enemies from that doorâ€™s queue.
- Reduces the count from the spawn queue accordingly.

---

## Spawn Blocking Check: `has_blocked_spawn_door(direction)`

```gdscript
func has_blocked_spawn_door(spawn_door_direction) -> bool:
    if spawn_door_direction == "up" and $UpSpawnDoorDetector.has_overlapping_bodies():
        return true
    elif spawn_door_direction == "right" and $RightSpawnDoorDetector2.has_overlapping_bodies():
        return true
    elif spawn_door_direction == "down" and $DownSpawnDoorDetector3.has_overlapping_bodies():
        return true
    elif spawn_door_direction == "left" and $LeftSpawnDoorDetector4.has_overlapping_bodies():
        return true
    else:
        return false
```

Checks whether a given door's detector overlaps with other bodies (e.g. player or enemies). Returns `true` if blocked.

---

## Random Utility Functions

### `get_enemies_to_spawn(number_of_enemies_to_spawn)`

```gdscript
func get_enemies_to_spawn(number_of_enemies_to_spawn: int):
    var selected_enemies_to_spawn_dict = {}
    var num_doorways = 4
    var chosen_indices = []
    var doorways = spawn_door_dict.keys()

    while chosen_indices.size() < num_doorways:
        var index = randi_range(0, 3)
        if index not in chosen_indices:
            chosen_indices.append(index)
            selected_enemies_to_spawn_dict[doorways[index]] = 0

    var i = 0
    var selected_doorways = selected_enemies_to_spawn_dict.keys()
    while number_of_enemies_to_spawn > 0:
        if number_of_enemies_to_spawn < MAX_NUM_SPAWN_PER_DOOR:
            MAX_NUM_SPAWN_PER_DOOR = number_of_enemies_to_spawn
        var iterated_doorway = selected_doorways[i % selected_doorways.size()]
        var rand_num = randi_range(0, MAX_NUM_SPAWN_PER_DOOR)
        selected_enemies_to_spawn_dict[iterated_doorway] += rand_num
        number_of_enemies_to_spawn -= rand_num
        i += 1

    return selected_enemies_to_spawn_dict
```

Distributes a total number of enemies randomly among selected doorways and returns a dictionary like:

```gdscript
{ "up": 2, "right": 1, "left": 3 }
```

---

### `get_random_amount_of_enemies()`

```gdscript
func get_random_amount_of_enemies():
    return randi_range(num_enemy_spawn_per_wave_range[0], num_enemy_spawn_per_wave_range[1])
```

Returns a random number of enemies to spawn in the next wave.

---

### `randomize_wait_time(level_of_difficulty)`

```gdscript
func randomize_wait_time(level_of_difficulty):
    spawn_timer.stop()
    $SpawnTimer.wait_time = randf_range(enemy_wave_spawn_time_range[0], enemy_wave_spawn_time_range[1])
    spawn_timer.start()
```

Randomizes the spawn interval within the configured range and restarts the timer.

---

## Difficulty Scaling Stub

```gdscript
func increase_difficulty():
    pass
```

Placeholder for increasing difficulty over time.

---

## Ending the Level

```gdscript
func _on_level_timer_timeout():
    difficulty_level = 0
```

Disables all spawning by resetting the difficulty level when the level ends.
