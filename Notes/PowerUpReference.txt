To create a system where power-ups in Godot affect multiple nodes like "gun", "player", and even enemies, you'll want to design your PowerUp system in a flexible and extendable way. Since each power-up type may interact with different parts of the game, you'll want to:

Define a base PowerUp class that all specific power-ups (like FireRatePowerUp, WheelPowerUp, NukePowerUp) can inherit from.
Create methods in the PowerUp base class that allow you to apply effects to the relevant nodes (like the gun, player, and enemies).
Use signals or direct references to communicate between the power-up node and the nodes it affects (such as player, gun, and enemies).
Handle specific behaviors for each power-up (e.g., a Nuke power-up would destroy enemies, while FireRatePowerUp would change the gun's fire rate).
Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Base PowerUp Node (PowerUp.gd):
This node will be inherited by specific power-ups, and it will contain common methods and signals to interact with other nodes.

gdscript
Copy
# PowerUp.gd (Base Class)
extends Node

# Signal to notify when a power-up is collected
signal power_up_collected(power_up: String)

# Function that can be overridden by specific power-ups to apply effects
func apply_effects(player: Node, gun: Node, enemies: Array) -> void:
	# This can be overridden in child classes to apply specific effects
	pass

# This is a generic method to simulate "collecting" the power-up
func collect(player: Node, gun: Node, enemies: Array) -> void:
	# Apply the effects on collection
	apply_effects(player, gun, enemies)
	# Emit the collected signal
	emit_signal("power_up_collected", self.name)
	queue_free()  # Remove the power-up after it's collected
2. Specific Power-Up Classes:
Each power-up, like FireRatePowerUp, WheelPowerUp, and NukePowerUp, will inherit from the PowerUp base class and override the apply_effects method.

Example: FireRatePowerUp.gd:
This power-up would affect the player's gun by changing its fire rate.

gdscript
Copy
# FireRatePowerUp.gd (Inherited from PowerUp)
extends PowerUp

var fire_rate_boost : float = 0.5  # Increase fire rate by 50%

func apply_effects(player: Node, gun: Node, enemies: Array) -> void:
	if gun and gun.has_method("increase_fire_rate"):
		gun.increase_fire_rate(fire_rate_boost)
	else:
		print("Gun node does not have 'increase_fire_rate' method.")
Example: NukePowerUp.gd:
This power-up would destroy all enemies in the level.

gdscript
Copy
# NukePowerUp.gd (Inherited from PowerUp)
extends PowerUp

func apply_effects(player: Node, gun: Node, enemies: Array) -> void:
	for enemy in enemies:
		if enemy and enemy.has_method("die"):  # Assuming enemies have a 'die' method
			enemy.die()  # Destroy the enemy
	print("All enemies destroyed by the Nuke!")
3. Handling the Power-Ups:
Now you'll need to handle power-ups in the scene. A good approach is to have the player collect the power-up, which will then apply the relevant effect.

In the player or game manager script, you can detect power-ups and call their collect() method:

gdscript
Copy
# Player.gd or GameManager.gd
extends Node

var player: Node  # Reference to the player node
var gun: Node     # Reference to the player's gun
var enemies: Array = []  # Array of enemies

# Called when power-up is collected
func _on_power_up_collected(power_up: String) -> void:
	print("Collected power-up: ", power_up)
	# Handle different power-ups if necessary
	match power_up:
		"FireRatePowerUp":
			# Already handled in FireRatePowerUp, no further code needed
			break
		"NukePowerUp":
			# No extra action needed, nuke power-up already affects enemies in its script
			break
		_:
			print("Unknown power-up collected!")

# This is where power-up collection is triggered (e.g., when the player collides with the power-up)
func on_power_up_collision(power_up_node: PowerUp) -> void:
	power_up_node.collect(player, gun, enemies)
In the example above, when the player collects a power-up, the collect() method is called, which will then trigger the apply_effects() method in the specific power-up class (like FireRatePowerUp or NukePowerUp).

4. Handling Power-Up Collection:
You’ll need some collision detection to handle when the player collides with a power-up. For this, you can use the Area2D or KinematicBody2D with a collision shape to detect the power-up collection.

Here’s an example using Area2D to detect when the player collects a power-up:

gdscript
Copy
# PowerUpArea.gd
extends Area2D

@export var power_up_scene: PackedScene

func _on_body_entered(body: Node) -> void:
	if body.is_in_group("player"):  # Make sure the player is the one who collects the power-up
		var power_up_instance = power_up_scene.instantiate()  # Get the power-up instance
		body.on_power_up_collision(power_up_instance)  # Let the player handle the power-up
		queue_free()  # Remove the area (and the power-up)
This script is attached to an Area2D node that will detect when the player enters the power-up's area. Once the player collides with the area, it triggers the collection logic and applies the power-up’s effects.

5. Organizing Enemies:
You may want to keep a reference to all enemies in the level to allow the NukePowerUp to target them. This could be done by either having a global singleton managing all enemies or having each enemy register itself with a central enemy manager when it spawns.

For example:

gdscript
Copy
# EnemyManager.gd
extends Node

var enemies: Array = []

func register_enemy(enemy: Node) -> void:
	enemies.append(enemy)

func remove_enemy(enemy: Node) -> void:
	enemies.erase(enemy)
Then, when the player collects a NukePowerUp, the NukePowerUp.gd script can access the enemies array and apply the effects.

Conclusion:
This system allows power-ups to interact with multiple different game objects (like the player, gun, and enemies) in a flexible and reusable way. Each power-up is a distinct node that modifies the game state, and the base PowerUp node handles the common logic for collecting power-ups. The specific effects for each power-up are handled by overriding the apply_effects method in each child class.

This setup gives you an easy way to add new power-ups and customize their effects while maintaining a clean and modular structure in your project.
